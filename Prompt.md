Make me a personal blog that displays my recent trips. It should be sorted by continent, include a dark/light mode toggle, and for each trip there should be an image, a rating of how I enjoyed the trip, and a description of my trip with a dedicated section for what I liked and what I didn’t like. Each trip should correspond to a different country, and I want you to implement 4 different fictitious trips set in Canada, Brazil, Egypt, and Japan. The UI must be built using React with JSX, should use reusable and well-structured components (for example, TripCard, ContinentSection, and ThemeToggle), and should be organized across multiple files following standard React project structure conventions.
