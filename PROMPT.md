I need you to act as a Senior React Developer to help me build a Personal Travel Journal application. I'm looking for a production-ready solution that follows a strict component-based architecture with full CRUD functionality rather than a simple static display.

First, please break the interface down into logical, reusable components and organize them in a real project folder structure. The project should include a `components` folder containing TripCard (for displaying trip image, rating, description, highlights, and considerations in a carousel format), ContinentItem (for continent-based filtering or navigation), ThemeToggle (for dark/light mode switching), RatingStars (for displaying star ratings), TripFormModal (for adding and editing trips), DestinationsModal (for viewing all trips), TripStats (for displaying travel statistics), SearchBar (for filtering trips), ConfirmationModal (for delete confirmations), FlashMessage (for toast notifications), and various utility components like Badge, Tooltip, and LoadingSpinner. Additionally, include a `data` folder for trip configurations and continent-country mappings with flag URLs, a `hooks` folder with custom hooks for theme management (useTheme), trip state management (useTrips), flash messages (useFlashMessage), and modal control (useModal), and a `styles` folder for custom CSS and animations. For styling, use Tailwind CSS to ensure the app is responsive and modern across all devices.

Regarding functionality, the app should be fully interactive with a carousel-based trip display, allowing users to navigate between trips with previous/next controls. Implement complete CRUD operations so users can add new trips, edit existing ones, and delete trips with confirmation. Include a dark/light mode toggle using a custom hook, ensuring theme preference persists via localStorage. Each trip card must display a representative image with error fallback handling, a star rating on a 1-5 scale, a description, a dedicated Highlights section for pros, a dedicated Considerations section for cons, travel notes, budget/expenses information, tags, date visited, and the country name with its flag image from an external CDN. Include a wishlist feature to mark future trip aspirations and a statistics dashboard showing countries visited, continents explored, and average ratings.

For the sample data, include trips across multiple continents: Canada (Banff) in North America with a 4/5 rating themed around winter adventure and mountain hiking, Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) in South America with a 5/5 rating themed around Carnival and beaches, Egypt (Luxor) in Africa with a 4/5 rating themed around ancient temples and the Nile, Japan (Kyoto) in Asia with a 5/5 rating themed around temples and traditional culture, plus additional trips to Italy, Greece, New Zealand, Thailand, Peru, and Antarctica to showcase variety. Each trip should include highlights array, lowlights array, travel notes, expense tracking, tags, and wishlist status.

Finally, please write clean, modular code with helpful comments explaining component interfaces. Use barrel exports (index.js) for clean imports, follow React best practices for component composition and separation of concerns, and implement proper error handling and loading states throughout the application.
